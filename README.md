# MyPortfolio
Hello Everyone !!

I'm Tamilthaaragai Muthukumar, a Computer Science Graduate Student at NC State University, Raleigh. I started pursuing Android Application Development in the recent times and this is gonna be my first attempt for publishing an app to the app store. In the sense, this would be my first project that I'm developing on my own. Apart from this, I have been a part of a team that developed BucketMap Raleigh. I'm also currently working with a team of innovative Engineers distributed globally for the development of one an App that will be out in the playstore in few months.

Tamil's Portfolio App is gonna be something that highlights my experiences so far in the Software Industry. With this app I'm gonna capture some of my best experiences with Web and Mobile platforms. In addition to that, this app would talk about my experiences beyond what my resume describes.

1. UI Design based on Material Design Guidelines
2. Gives a quick overview of my background and educational qualifications
3. Snapshots of Web and Mobile projects that I have done so far
4. My technical skillset
5. Interesting experiences that I have come across with technology
